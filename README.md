# stochastic-processes

I know many students and researchers in Operations, Management Science, Statistics, and so on have to write code to define and simulate stochastic processes. I did this for hundreds of problems. Therefore, I share some of my codes and hope they will help somebody. 
Most of these questions can be found in the Simulation book by Sheldon Ross (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/C2011-0-04574-X), but I won't compile them as a copiable solution manual ;)
